# awesome-ebpf-cloud-native

**awesome-ebpf-cloud-native** is a curated, community-driven hub for resources at the intersection of **eBPF and cloud-native technologies**. It helps developers, SREs, and researchers understand how eBPF enhances **networking, observability, tracing, profiling, and security** in Kubernetes, service meshes, containers, and cloud-native platforms.

## Why This Project?

eBPF is transforming cloud-native systems, enabling high-performance networking, zero-instrumentation observability, and kernel-level security. While resources exist, they are scattered and often general-purpose. This repository consolidates knowledge specifically for **cloud-native use cases**, making it easier for users to learn, adopt, and contribute.

## Resource Categories

- **Tools & Docs**: Core eBPF-powered projects and official documentation, including Cilium, Pixie, Falco, Hubble, Parca, and more.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for deploying and using eBPF in Kubernetes, containers, and cloud-native systems.
- **Blogs**: Conceptual and practical posts explaining eBPF concepts, lessons learned, and real-world insights.
- **Talks & Videos**: Conference presentations, webinars, and community talks on eBPF in cloud-native environments.
- **Use Cases**: Real-world deployments showing how eBPF improves performance, observability, and security.
- **Future Trends / Research**: Emerging projects, papers, RFCs, and research exploring next-generation cloud-native eBPF applications.

> Each resource is tagged with **difficulty levels** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) to help users navigate efficiently.
